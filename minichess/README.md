#Code guide
The code from a submission to the class [CS542 at Portland State University](http://wiki.cs.pdx.edu/cs542-spring2013/), which teaches AI by using MinitChess, much the same way we do with Pacman, was used as a chess engine as a starting point, so that we could focus on the reinforcement learning part of this problem. [The original code can be viewed here] 
)https://github.com/sector46/teaching-minichess). The q-learning agent is written in the file ``zeromq.py" in the directory ``client-python". Both ``Cython" and ``pyzmq" must be installed in order to run this. There are two classes in ``zeromq.py," one titled ``OpeningBookCalculator," which is how q-values were generated, and another titled  ``OpeningBookExploiter," which has the full array of q-values from over 6000 simulations. 

All files in results were generated by running ``python main.py >> results/filename.txt,"
and analysis was done by either in the file of, or by a simple grep search counting the lines of ``W\textbackslash n", ``B\textbackslash n", and ``=\textbackslash n" to get win-loss-draw percentages. The GUI provided was used for generation, the GUI can be run by first making and running ``./framework" in the directory ``framework/,"  then running ``python main.py" in ``gui/", and going to ``localhost:8080" on your favorite internet browser.
